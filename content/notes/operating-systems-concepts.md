Modern operating systems play a very important role: it provides an environment for several user processes to run concurrently on a machine, abstracts low-level hardware details (memory management, communicating with peripherals, etc..) by acting as an intermediary between user-space application and the hardware, and much more. In this post, I aim to dig deeper to understand the role of an operating system, and the interface it presents to the applications running in user-space.

## Resource management & abstraction

A computer system uses three main resources to do computational work:

1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2. Memory
3. I/O devices

The operating system's primary job is to manage and abstract the details of these underlying computing resources from the user application. Therefore, it must be intimately involved with hardware resources such as memory, CPU time, storage space, I/O devices, and so on. Let's look at some examples of how the operating system 

### Memory


### CPU


### I/O


## Life without an operating system

Now that we know a little more about computer system structures.



## Boot Process
I talk more about the boot process in a separate post.


## OS Mechanism: Processes and Threads
