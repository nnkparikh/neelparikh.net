In an event-driven programming paradigm, the execution flow of the program is determined by the events that occur within a system. Many systems are inherently event-based: web applications need to handle user-generated events such as mouse clicks and keyboard input; network application need to act on incoming network packets; traffic enforcement cameras need to detect vehicles exceeding the speed limit. In each of these examples, an event is generated and handled appropriately within the system.


Two players involved: 1) Event Emitter 2) Event Consumer 
Questions:  
- How are events represented internally ?  
- How are events detected ?  
- How is polling avoided ?  
- Patterns employed
