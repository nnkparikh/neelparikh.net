In an event-driven programming paradigm, the execution flow of the program is determined by the events that occur within a system. Many systems are inherently event-based: web applications need to handle user-generated events such as mouse clicks and keyboard input; network application need to act on incoming network packets; traffic enforcement cameras need to detect vehicles exceeding the speed limit. In each of these examples, an event is generated and handled appropriately within the system.

Generally, there are two entities involved when dealing with events: the event emitter, and the even handler.
